# Comfy-Discord-Theme-alt
Note: This theme is originally made by NYRI4, you can find her on GitHub aswell. All the credits go to her. She updated the theme which people including me didn't like, so this is the older verison of the theme. If you wish to recieve updates, head over to NYRI4's repo and download from there! https://github.com/NYRI4/Comfy
